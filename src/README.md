## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vite
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React Router
- [Tailwindcss](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I was able to implement a protected route which could only be accessed when a valid email address has been provided by the user because I didn't want a situation whereby a user would basically search in the success url path("/success") and get access to the success page without passing in their email.

```js
<Route
  path="success"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <SuccessPage />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
/>

function ProtectedRoute({ children }) {
  const { isAuthenticated } = useEmailAuth();
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  
  useEffect(
    function () {
      if (!isAuthenticated) {
        navigate("/");
      }
    },
    [isAuthenticated, navigate],
  );

  return isAuthenticated ? children : null;
}
```

### Continued development

Still trying to adapt to using tailwind and I'm thankful the tailwind documentation is easy to understand, definitely styling more projects with TailwindcssüòÅüíØ.
